Patients today often face several challenges when trying to access essential healthcare services. One of the biggest issues is the lack of real-time information regarding hospital facilities, such as bed availability, doctor availability, and medical equipment status. This forces patients to either visit multiple hospitals or spend hours making calls just to find the right place for treatment.
Another major problem is the inefficient appointment system. Without a proper digital platform, patients often have to wait in long queues or make multiple trips just to book an appointment to consult a doctor, which can be especially stressful during emergencies or for elderly patients.To make matters worse, even after getting a consultation, they might find that the prescribed medicines are unavailable at nearby pharmacies, leading to delays in starting treatment and a lot of inconvenience.
These gaps in the current healthcare access system lead to unnecessary stress, wasted time, and in some cases, worsened health conditions due to delays.

Our solution Care360 aims to bridge these gaps through a centralized, real-time platform.
